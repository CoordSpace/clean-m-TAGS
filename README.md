# clean-m-TAGS
 
 A simple python script for cleaning up stray m-TAGS and directories from music collections based around foobar2000 and the wonderful [m-TAGS](http://www.m-tags.org/) component by Luigi Mercurio.
 
 Useful for those times when you delete all that 70s prog-rock from your collection that you never listen to and need the m-TAGS metadata directories to mirror those changes. 
 
 Tested on Windows 10 and linux (Debian/Mint).
 
 # Installation
 
 Just run the script using whatever python you have installed. It only uses default libraries so pip can take a break.
 
 # Usage 
 
 `python clean_mtags.py "\mtag\path"`
